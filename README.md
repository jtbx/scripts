# scripts

(Usually POSIX-compliant) Shell scripts I make to save time.

## Included scripts

* `weather`; curl wttr.in with more options and configuration

* `ctermlist`; print out your terminal emulator's supported colours

* `launch_minecraft`; launch Minecraft (via minecraft-launcher-cmd) with ease and security

### Install scripts

* `librewolf_INSTALL.sh`; install LibreWolf for your distribution

     Supports Debian, Fedora, SUSE, and Arch

### Other scripts

* `distro_detect.sh`; detect a user's distribution based on their package manager

    Intented for use inside another shell script
